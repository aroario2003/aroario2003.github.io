    Introduction
</h2>
<p class="intropa"> This website was created for people who want to learn Linux but have no idea what it is or what it means to be a Linux user. When going through this page you will not only learn what Linux is but what free software is and who inveneted it. You will also learn about Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux Kernel and much more.</p>
<h2 id="about">
    About Me
</h2>
<p class="aboutpa"> My name is Alejandro Rosario, I am 17 years old and I have been working with Linux for the past two years. Although, I may seem to have experience I know very little about Linux not because I actually dont know a lot but more because there are so mahy things to learn in linux that I know very little comparitively. That being said, If I say anything that maybe false information please contact me and tell me about my mistake. Everything else aside, I started with Linux like a lot of people do, on Ubuntu and than after about a week moved to a distrobution of Linux by the name of <a class="kali" href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a>, which is where I learned how to do some basic penetration testing and hacking. I have since moved on to a more traditional desktop use of Linux, I now run <a class="manjaro" href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro</a> which is an Arch linux based distrobution of Linux. If you didn't understand much of that that, no need to worry, I will explain further on in this article.</p>
</div>
<div class=section2>
    <h2 id="Linux">
        What is Linux?
    </h2>
<p class="Linuxpa"> Linux or as it is correctly refrenced GNU/Linux is a free and open source operating system, meaning it is free as in price and free as in freedom. Although, Linux may not be very popular, I and many others think it is a great operating system overall. As a two year long linux user I have found a minimal amount of problems using it daily and in Virtual Machines. Everything else aside, there is a misconception about Linux and its name, most people just call it "Linux" whereas it is really "GNU/Linux". GNU is a part of the Linux OS which integrates some of the utilities which were developed by Richard M. Stallman and the free software foundation into Linux. Linux on the other hand is a kernel which differs widely from a whole operating system.</p>
<h2 id="FS">
    Free Software
</h2>
<p class="FSpa"> Free Software is a type of software where the user has the right to look at and modify the source code however they choose. The idea of free software is often misunderstood, people usually think it is only free as in price yet it is free as in freedom as well. With free software, you gain the ability to have complete control over what your software does. As I mentioned in the last section, free software was invented by Richard M. Stallman and he is the reason why Linux exists today aside from Linus Torvalds who I will talk about later in this article.  </p>
</div>
<div class="section3">
    <h2 id="linus">
        Linus Torvalds
    </h2>
    <p class="linuspa"> Linus Torvalds or the creator of the Linux kernel is a respected figure within the Linux community. Linus started his development of the Linux kernel in 1991 which he was intending to make closed source yet when Richard Stallman came out with GNU and free software Linus decided that he would make the kernel FOSS which has lead to what we know today as the GNU/Linux operating system. Linus today still maintains the kernel yet he does not write much code anymore, he usually only revises the code written by other maintainers if he has the time.</p>
