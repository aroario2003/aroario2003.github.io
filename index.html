    Introduction
</h2>
<p class="intropa"> This website was created for people who want to learn Linux but have no idea what it is or what it means to be a Linux user. When going through this page you will not only learn what Linux is but what free software is and who inveneted it. You will also learn about Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux Kernel and much more.</p>
<h2 class="about">
    About Me
</h2>
<p class="aboutpa"> My name is Alejandro Rosario, I am 17 years old and I have been working with Linux for the past two years. Although, I may seem to have experience I know very little about Linux not because I actually dont know a lot but more because there are so mahy things to learn in linux that I know very little comparitively. That being said, If I say anything that maybe false information please contact me and tell me about my mistake. Everything else aside, I started with Linux like a lot of people do, on Ubuntu and than after about a week moved to a distrobution of Linux by the name of <a class="kali" href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a>, which is where I learned how to do some basic penetration testing and hacking. I have since moved on to a more traditional desktop use of Linux, I now run <a class="manjaro" href="https://manjaro.org/">Manjaro</a> which is an Arch linux based distrobution of Linux. If you didn't understand much of that that, no need to worry, I will explain further on in this article.</p>
